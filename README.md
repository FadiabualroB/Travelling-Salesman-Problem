Solving Travelling Salesman Problem using c#
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest yet most efficient route for a person to take given a list of specific destinations. It is a well-known algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research. There are obviously a lot of different routes to choose from but finding the best one (the one that will require the least distance or cost) is what mathematicians and computer scientists have spent decades trying to solve for.
